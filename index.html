    <h1>Jake Feldman Starosta</h1>

    <p>i'm in my third year studying <a href ="https://www.queensu.ca/mathstat/undergraduate/prospective-undergraduate/mthe"> math and engineering </a> at queen's, originally from ottawa.</p>
    
    <p>these days, my time goes into schoolwork, building a micro-humidifier, chairing an <a href="https://cucai.ca/"> ai conference</a>, directing some cool ai projects and squeezing in the odd movie. </p>
    <p>hit me up if you're looking for a running partner or to talk philosophy over coffee. </p>
